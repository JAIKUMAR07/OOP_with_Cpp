/*
âœ… What is a Constructor?
A constructor is a special member function of a class that:

Has the same name as the class.

Automatically gets called when an object of the class is created.

Is used to initialize objects.

ðŸŽ¯ Real-World Analogy:
Think of a constructor like the registration desk at a hotel:

As soon as a guest (object) arrives (gets created), the registration desk (constructor) automatically collects their info (initializes values like name, room number, etc.).

No need to ask the guest to explicitly call registration â€“ it just happens.




| Type                          | Description                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Default Constructor**       | No arguments, initializes to default values                       |
| **Parameterized Constructor** | Takes arguments to initialize object                              |
| **Copy Constructor**          | Initializes object using another object of same class             |
| **Constructor Overloading**   | Multiple constructors in the same class with different parameters |
